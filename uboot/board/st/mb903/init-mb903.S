	 * host% romgen --show-comment <stmc2>:mb903stx7108:host,boot_companions=0

	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * At the time of writing this (July 2010) the output from "romgen"
	 * needs to be edited slightly.  The edit is just two add two lines
	 * to comment out all the PMB + 32-bit mode configuration. The lines
	 * to comment out start with the pokes that setup the PMB arrays,
	 * and end with pokes that configure the CCN registers.
	 * That is, the following two lines should be added:
	 *		#if 0
	 *		#endif
	 * See the supplied version of the ".romgen" file, to see where
	 * these have been added, if there is any doubt.
